3. What skills are most in demand for Software Engineers?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the Software Engineer job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:
- **SQL**: The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL**: The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code**: My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub**: Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.
  
# The Analysis

## Top Paying Roles
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered Software positions by average yearly salary and location. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

```SQL
SELECT

    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    company_dim.name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON company_dim.company_id = job_postings_fact.company_id
WHERE job_title LIKE '%Software%' AND
      job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
      salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
Here's the breakdown of the top Software Engineer jobs in 2023:

## Top In-demand Skills
This query aims to identify the top 10 most in-demand skills for software-related jobs by counting how frequently each skill appears across job postings.

```SQL
SELECT
    skills,
    COUNT (skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count
FROM 
    job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact. job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE job_title_short LIKE '%Software%'
GROUP BY
    skills
ORDER BY
    demand_count DESC
LIMIT 10
```

Here's the breakdown of the most in demand skills for a Software Engineer in 2023:
- Programming languages like **Python**, **Java**, and **JavaScript** remain fundamental, while cloud platforms and containerization tools (AWS, Azure, Kubernetes, Docker) are becoming increasingly vital in the industry.

## Skills Based on Salary
Exploring the average salaries associated with different skills revealed which skillsare the highest paying.

```SQL
SELECT
    skills,
    ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg), 2) avg_salary
FROM 
    job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact. job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE job_title_short LIKE '%Software%' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
    skills
ORDER BY
    avg_salary DESC
LIMIT 30
```

Here's the breakdown of the top paying skills for a Software Engineer in 2023:
- **Top-Paying Skills:** Specialized databases like **Cassandra ($213,333)** and **Neo4j ($183,840)** lead due to their niche demand.
- **Frameworks:** Competitive salaries for **ASP.NET Core ($155,000)** and **Ruby on Rails ($149,500)**; slightly lower for widely used tools like **Express.js ($143,816)**.
