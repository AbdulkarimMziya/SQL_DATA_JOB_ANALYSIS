# Background
The tech industry continues to grow rapidly, with Software Engineers among the most sought-after professionals worldwide. 
Companies increasingly look for candidates with expertise in programming, data analysis, and emerging technologies. 
However, not all skills and roles are equal in terms of demand and compensation.

### The questions I wanted to answer through my
SQL queries were:
1. What are the top-paying Software Engineer jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for Software Engineers?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the Software Engineer job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:
- **SQL**: The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL**: The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code**: My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub**: Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.
